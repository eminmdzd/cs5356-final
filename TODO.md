- Cloud storage
- Extract PDF text on client since there are Next server action body size limits
  - PDF file still stored in bucket storage along with processed audio file
- Add hover state to buttons
- send emails

**_Minor nitpicking_**

- the eye icon to see the password should be on the right, not over the password itself on the left
- make it so that audio book name can be changed
- update readme.md
- make the popup for "are you sure you want to delete" prettier
- sign in page is ugly

**_Issues_**

- make sure every user in global blob storage gets audio and pdf files under their user directory

**_Done_**
