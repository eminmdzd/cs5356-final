***Nice to have***
- Preprocess documents with an LLM to "clean" it for TTS.
- Non monotonic voice

***Todo***
- duration should appear immediately after completion
- optimistic ui updates without hard refresh on title edits and audiobook deletions
- regenerate functionality does not work and is stuck at 5%
- as audiobook is being generated, pending -> processing -> completed does not change automatically and only changes upon hard refresh. also, not consistent across dashboard, audiobooks and audiobook details page. Maybe a central store would help for those to ensure consistency. however, needs to be fast for good UX
