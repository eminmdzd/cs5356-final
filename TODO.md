***Nice to have***
- Preprocess documents with an LLM to "clean" it for TTS.
- Non monotonic voice

***Todo***
- somehow verify that created chunks are correct
- Improve responsiveness on various screen sizes

**_Issues_**
- slow, pruning paper from hardware for example took 3-4 mins but better

***Won't fix***
- Extract PDF text on client since there are Next server action body size limits
- Long PDFs error out with: Error generating audio with Google TTS for audiobook


***Minor nitpicks***
